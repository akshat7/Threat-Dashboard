# Threat Intelligent Dashboard
In the current era of cyber warfare and security threat attacks, it comes as a crucial need to constantly monitor and analyse the ongoing threats and day to day malicious activities. The Cyber Threat Intelligence Analysis project created by me deals with real-time extraction of raw threat intelligence data like malicious IP addresses, latest information regarding botnets, malwares, spams, phishing domains across the world from multiple reliable sources and threat feeds across the internet, and make a statistical dashboard of this data, which includes real-time updation of multiple statistical visualisations like threat intelligence pie-charts, GeoIP maps, country comparisons, date-time analysis and other data aggregation techniques. This Threat intelligence Dashboard will help analysing the day to day cyber attacks happening in different regions of the world and their impact on organisations. It will also help in making the current system security better by analysing the threats and taking measures in accordance with the same.
